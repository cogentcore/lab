# TODO notes for plot

* max fixed on X axis has no effect

* legend role in style, plus something somewhere that does the group function etc to make it work -- this is tricky.

* can't update plot in simrun when selecting new results. and simrun plot seems to be additive: keeps adding to original data instead of making a new thing to plot, when selecting multiple.
