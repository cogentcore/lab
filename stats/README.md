# stats

There are several packages here for operating on [tensor](../), and [table](../table) data, for computing standard statistics and performing related computations, such as normalizing the data.

* [stats](stats) computes standard summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc).

* [metric](metric) computes similarity / distance metrics for comparing two tensors, and associated distance / similarity matrix functions.

* [cluster](cluster) implements agglomerative clustering of items based on [metric](metric) distance / similarity matrix data.

* [convolve](convolve) convolves data (e.g., for smoothing).

* [glm](glm) fits a general linear model for one or more dependent variables as a function of one or more independent variables.  This encompasses all forms of regression.

* [histogram](histogram) bins data into groups and reports the frequency of elements in the bins.
