This example (source in https://github.com/cogentcore/lab/tree/main/physics/examples/virtroom) demonstrates how to use the `PlaneXZ` joint to move an object around on the plane, and how to use the physics API in a simulation context. Sensors for physical values and capturing the "first person" view from the eye of the virtual agent are also demonstrated.
