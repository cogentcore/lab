This example (source in https://github.com/cogentcore/lab/tree/main/physics/examples/collide) demonstrates the collision dynamics of different shapes. Do `Rebuild` after changing shapes or other parameters such as friction. The `Cylinder` and `Cone` shapes are not well supported for collision.

The pusher target position slider at the bottom controls how much force is imparted by the pusher "paddle" that hits the first object.
